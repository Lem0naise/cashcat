// This file is intentionally left as a thin wrapper.
// The actual data models have been moved to:
//   Shared/Models/SpendingData.swift
//
// In Xcode, remove this file from the CashCatWidgetExtension target
// and instead add Shared/Models/SpendingData.swift to both targets.
//
// Keeping this file temporarily to avoid build breakage until
// you update the Xcode project target membership.
