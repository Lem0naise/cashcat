                        <p>CashCat is a personal budget tracking and planning application that helps users organize their financial information, set goals, and track spending categories. CashCat is purely a budgeting tool and does not provide financial services, investment guidance, professional financial services, or handle real money in any way. We have no ability to change any information related to any accounts you hold at any financial institutions or banks, and no permission is requested for CashCat to do so. All financial management and transactions remain under your complete control. You are solely responsible for all financial decisions and the accuracy of data you input into the application. The service is provided for informational purposes only. CashCat does not provide or claim to provide financial advise. You agree that you are using the service at your own risk and you are solely responsible for any financial decisions you make. Any information provided is not a substitute for professional financial advice from a qualified advisor.
